# Computer Vision #
This folder contains some Python programs that implement different Computer Vision techniques.
Some of the program has been done following the online course on udemy Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Zâ„¢: OpenCV, SSD & GANs:

In particular, right now the following programs are present:
* Face Recognition and Smile Detector: 
  
  The programs are implemented in Python 3 using openCV2 library and they can recognize face, eyes and smile in real time from the webcam

* SSD Object Detection: 

  Recognize object in a video using SSD( Single Shot Multibox Detector). The program is implemented in Python 3 using a pretrained SSD    network able to recognize from 30 to 40 objects
